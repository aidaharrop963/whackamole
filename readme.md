Chris H's Whack-A-Mole v0.1
===========================

Javascript/HTML game written as a challenge by Rob at work.

I wrote this in about a day, including making the graphics. The hardest part was figuring out how to create the overall game controller. Looking back at it, I probably could've cleaned it up a bit more, and organized the comments better. Had a great time making it though :)
